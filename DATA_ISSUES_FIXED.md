# Data Issues Fixed - Market Bias Terminal

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Market Hours Logic Blocking Data Fetch**
**Problem**: The system only fetched data during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST), showing "No data available" outside these times.

**Fix**: Modified `marketStore.ts` to always fetch data regardless of market status, allowing users to see historical data and news even when markets are closed.

### 2. **Missing Fallback Displays**
**Problem**: Dashboard components only rendered when data existed, leaving empty spaces when data was unavailable.

**Fix**: Added loading placeholders for:
- NIFTY/BANKNIFTY bias cards
- Key levels panels
- All components now show "Loading..." states instead of being blank

### 3. **Error Handling Issues**
**Problem**: Individual data fetch failures would show error states for the entire dashboard.

**Fix**: Improved error handling to log individual failures without breaking the entire dashboard experience.

### 4. **Mock Data Reliability**
**Problem**: LiveAdapter was configured to use mock fallback, but the system wasn't optimized for this.

**Fix**: Ensured MockAdapter is the default data source with reliable mock data generation.

## Data Sources Status

### Current Configuration
- **Default Data Source**: MockAdapter (reliable, always available)
- **Live Data**: Disabled by default (requires API configuration)
- **Mock Fallback**: Enabled in LiveAdapter

### Mock Data Includes
- ✅ NIFTY/BANKNIFTY OHLC data (30 days)
- ✅ Previous day high/low data
- ✅ Sector performance data
- ✅ Market news (8 sample articles)
- ✅ Stock information
- ✅ Market hours detection
- ✅ Trading holidays

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. **API Integration**
To enable live data, you'll need to:
- Configure real API endpoints in `LiveAdapter.ts`
- Set up API keys in environment variables
- Update the `useLiveData` setting in user preferences

### 2. **Data Reliability**
- Mock data is refreshed every 5-15 minutes
- News data includes sentiment analysis
- All data includes proper error handling

### 3. **User Experience**
- Dashboard now shows loading states instead of blank spaces
- Data fetches regardless of market hours
- Better error messages and user feedback

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Visit the dashboard**: You should now see:
   - Loading states for all components
   - Mock data populating within seconds
   - No more "No data available" messages
   - Proper market status indicators

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Live APIs**: Replace mock endpoints with real market data APIs
2. **Add Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live data
3. **Enhance Data Quality**: Add more sophisticated bias calculation algorithms
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to toggle between mock and live data

## Files Modified

- `src/store/marketStore.ts` - Fixed market hours logic and error handling
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added fallback displays for missing data
- `src/adapters/LiveAdapter.ts` - Ensured mock fallback is enabled
- `src/adapters/MockAdapter.ts` - Already had comprehensive mock data

The dashboard should now display data reliably regardless of market hours or data availability issues.
